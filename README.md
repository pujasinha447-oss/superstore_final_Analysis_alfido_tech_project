# Superstore Sales Data Analysis â€“ Exploratory Insights

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Superstore sales dataset. The dataset includes approximately **9,800 rows and 18 columns**, capturing detailed transactional and customer-level information. The analysis focuses on data cleaning, preprocessing, and deriving actionable insights to support business decisions.

## Project Objectives
- Perform initial data exploration and validation.  
- Handle missing values, particularly in the **Postal_Code** column.  
- Remove irrelevant fields such as **Row_ID** (serial number) and **Country** (single constant value).  
- Add helper columns to enhance exploratory analysis.  
- Uncover sales, customer, and product trends through structured EDA.  
- Visualize findings for clear and interpretable insights.  

## Methodology
- **Data Cleaning**: Addressed null values, dropped redundant columns, and ensured dataset readiness for analysis.  
- **Feature Engineering**: Added helper variables to assist in trend discovery and segmentation.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Conducted distribution checks, categorical insights, and correlation studies.  
- **Visualization**: Applied charts and plots to reveal sales drivers, customer patterns, and product performance.  

## Insights and Applications
The analysis highlights critical dimensions of Superstore performance by identifying:  
- Sales distribution across regions, categories, and customer segments.  
- Impact of missing data handling on analytical accuracy.  
- Key product and segment-level contributors to revenue.  
- Patterns useful for strategic decision-making in retail and operations.  

This makes the notebook valuable for **retail analysts, business intelligence teams, and data science practitioners** aiming to optimize sales performance.  

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Data handling and analysis  
- **Pandas, NumPy**: Data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**: Visualization  
- **Statsmodels**: Statistical insights  

## Conclusion
This project transforms raw Superstore sales data into structured business insights. By integrating data cleaning, feature engineering, and visualization, it provides a practical framework for analyzing retail datasets and supporting evidence-based decision-making.
